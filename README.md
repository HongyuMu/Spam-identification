# Spam-identification

This is a email spam dataset that consists of 4601 email messages, from which 57 features have been extracted. We prepossed the data using standardization, log transform, and a discretizing indicator.
In each part b-e, we applied a logistic regression model, linear and and quadratic discriminant analysis methods, linear and nonlinear support vector machine classifiers, and 3 tree-based classifiers.
The table shows the conclusion.

This project is completed by 3 UCSD students as their final project to Math189:
Hongyu Mu; Chenxi Li; Zening Wang.
